    <h1> Adventures in Code-Fu </h1>
    <h2> My HTML Journey frome <mark> Chaos </mark> to <mark> Cat Videos </mark> </h2>
    <h3> Or, how I accidently created a self-playing cat video website (and almost lost my sanity) </h3>
    <p> Armed with boundless enthusiasm and zero coding experience, I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> HTML.</mark> 
        <br> <small>Little</small> did I know my journey would be less <b> "Lord of the rings"</b> and more <b> "Three Stooges."</b></p>
    <p> My <ins> first website </ins> lovingly named <b>" Brenda's Bloosming Boutique,"</b> resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock</mark> painting.
        <br> Tags were <del>scattered</del> like <i>confetti</i>, colors clashed like a sunset on <mark>Mars,</mark> and the navigation system could only be 
        <br> described as "<b>whimsical</b>" <sub>(by a very generous browser)</sub></p>
    <p> Deterimined to reedem myself, I tackled a "<b>simple</b>" project <mark> a cat video gallery.</mark> what enused was a <i>hilarious</i>
     <br><ins>(and slightly terrifying)</ins> <ins>ballet of misplaced semicolons,</ins> <ins>rougue line breaks,</ins> and <ins>images</ins> that danced uncontrollably
    <br><del>across</del> the screen. At one point,my entire website transformed into an <i>auto-playing cat video slideshow,</i> much to
     <br> the amusement <sub>and slight concern</sub> of my family.
     <p>After <ins>several meldtowns,</ins> <ins>countless tutorials,</ins> and <ins>gallons of coffee,</ins> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i>submission</i> 
     <br>My cat video gallery wasn't exactly "<b>elegant,</b>" but it functioned <sub>(mostly)</sub>. And hey, atleast I learned that even the <mark>clumsiest 
    <br> coder</mark> can create something... <i>Interesting.</i> So, Here's to <mark>Brenda's Bloosoming Boutique, the self-playing cat video extravaganza</mark>
     <br> and the <del>never-ending</del> quest to master the art of <mark>HTML!</mark></p>
